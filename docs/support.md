## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### What is ValuTime?

ValuTime is an iOS app designed for freelancers and professionals who want to track their time while assigning a monetary value to it. It helps you understand how every moment contributes to your overall productivity and financial goals.

#### Is my data secure?

Yes! ValuTime stores all your data locally on your device using Core Data. Your sensitive financial information never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.

#### Does ValuTime require an internet connection?

No, ValuTime works completely offline. All tracking and calculations happen on your device.

### Time Tracking

#### How does ValuTime calculate my hourly worth?

ValuTime calculates your hourly worth in two ways:

1. **All Hours**: Divides your total earnings by all available hours in the period (from midnight to the current time for today)
2. **Tracked Hours Only**: Divides your total earnings by only the hours you've actively tracked

You can toggle between these two calculation methods in the app.

#### Why does my idle time change throughout the day?

Idle time is calculated as the difference between the total elapsed time since midnight and your tracked time. As the day progresses, the total available time increases, which affects the idle time calculation.

#### Can I track multiple activities simultaneously?

No, ValuTime is designed to track one activity at a time, as this provides the most accurate representation of how you're spending your time.

### Financial Calculations

#### How are earnings calculated for activities?

Earnings are calculated by multiplying the hourly rate (either from the activity or its associated project) by the duration of the activity session.

#### Why is my average hourly worth different from my hourly rate?

Your average hourly worth considers all your activities and idle time (if using "All Hours" mode). If you have untracked time or activities with different rates, your average hourly worth will differ from any individual hourly rate.

## Troubleshooting

### App Performance

#### The app is using too much battery

ValuTime is designed to be battery-efficient. If you notice excessive battery usage:

1. Check if background app refresh is enabled for only essential apps
2. Ensure you're running the latest version of ValuTime
3. Restart your device

#### Time tracking stopped unexpectedly

If time tracking stops unexpectedly:

1. Check if you have Low Power Mode enabled, which can restrict background activities
2. Ensure ValuTime has the necessary permissions
3. Try restarting the app

### Data Issues

#### My activities aren't showing up correctly

If your activities aren't displaying properly:

1. Pull down to refresh the dashboard
2. Check if the date filters are set correctly
3. Restart the app
4. If the issue persists, contact support

#### I lost some of my tracking data

ValuTime automatically saves your data. If you believe you've lost data:

1. Check different date ranges to ensure the data isn't filtered out
2. Verify that you didn't accidentally delete the activity or project
3. If you can't locate your data, contact support with details about what's missing
